Konnected is an app for small companies and startups to post their projects and hire junior developers. The website is fully built on Ruby on Rails. Two interfaces exist one for business owners to post their projects and one for junior dev's to apply to those. Developers can only apply to projects according to their qualification level. 
This qualification level improves based on their completion of projects allowing developers without much experience to still be able to find some work. 
The backend, markup and css have been completed but we still need to animate and give some behaviour to the UI with javascript.

You can see the final result here ðŸ‘‰ https://konnect-ed.herokuapp.com/
